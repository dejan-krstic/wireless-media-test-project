# Wireless Media Test Project


Single Page Application, created with jQuery, Bootstrap and DataTables plugin as a test project applying for a Front-End position.

Application supports sorting and searching/filtering by every column, creating new element and tag type(with bootstrap modal), editing existing rows(inbuilt DataTables feature) and deleting. After every action table refreshes and after row creation user is led to the last pagination entry. Uploaded image has preview which displays only center of the image and can be dismissed on click. 

Application doesn't have back-end, after page reloads entered data resets (prerequisite).
